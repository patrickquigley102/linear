Learn about Linear Regression and ML.

## Overview

- src/exercise1
  - Build my own LR model, compare to scikit-learn with very simple data.
- src/exercise2
  - [This Kaggle course](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ryanholbrook/linear-regression-with-time-series/tutorial) from Ryan Holbrook.
  - You need to download the data from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ryanholbrook/linear-regression-with-time-series/data) and add it to `data/exercise2`. If you wish to run the code again.

## Setup

Start with

```
make build
...
docker-compose up
```

Then point your VSCode to `http://127.0.0.1:8888/tree` for the Jupyter notebook Python Kernel.
